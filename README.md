[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alessandro-caldonazzi/session-jwt.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/alessandro-caldonazzi/session-jwt)
[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ff8c6396456b40eaaa5354a0804d1cea)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/alessandro-caldonazzi/session-ws?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=alessandro-caldonazzi/session-ws&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## ATTENTION: session-ws is completely changing, its new name is session-jwt
The package will now include the use of JWT and Refresh-Token.

### The old session-ws will remain available in the "deprecated" brach, but will not be officially supported

## My Project flow
The development takes place in the "develop" branch, it is subsequently brought to the brach master only during new publications on npm (only after first publish, scheduled for 8 June 2020), in this way the master branch will always remain deployable
