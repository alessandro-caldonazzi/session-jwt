# session-jwt | WIP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alessandro-caldonazzi/session-jwt.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/alessandro-caldonazzi/session-jwt)

## ATTENTION: session-ws is completely changing, its new name is session-jwt.
The package will now include the use of JWT and Refresh-Token.

### The old session-ws will remain available in the "deprecated" brach, but will not be officially supported


## My Project flow

The development takes place in the "develop" branch, it is subsequently brought to the brach master only during new publications on npm (only after first publish, scheduled for 8 June 2020), in this way the master branch will always remain deployable
